Watchlistr is a web application that allows you to create an account to search for and discover popular &and top-rated movies and TV shows, as well as TV shows airing today and upcoming movies (both updates periodically). Plus, with the personal watchlist feature, you can create and save your must-watch content for later.

This project is the inception of my journey into project development. Should you wish to adapt and enhance it, you're welcome to do so. I encourage a thorough read for seamless building and deployment of your Watchlistr website.
